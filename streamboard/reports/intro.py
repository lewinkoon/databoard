    "The TAVI placement process is typically a **manual** task, which means no two prostheses are positioned exactly the same way."

    "**Height** of placement is a crucial factor to consider due to its potential impact on the conduction system and, consequently, the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation post-procedure [2]. Nevertheless, the effect of TAVI height on hemodynamic flow has not yet been studied."

    "Currently, the influence of **prosthesis alignment** is an increasingly studied factor. For example, the ACA clinical trial is examining how commissural alignment affects various clinical parameters [3]. This has also been studied through CFD simulations, though only with virtual geometries and always limited to the aortic root and ascending aorta [4]."
