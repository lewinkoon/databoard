    **Aortic valve prostheses** are becoming an increasingly popular option for patients with severe aortic stenosis and high surgical risk [1].
    
    The TAVI placement process is typically a **manual** task, which means no two prostheses are positioned exactly the same way.
    **Height** of placement is a crucial factor to consider due to its potential impact on the conduction system and, consequently, the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation post-procedure [2]. Nevertheless, the effect of TAVI height on hemodynamic flow has not yet been studied.
    
    Currently, the influence of **prosthesis alignment** is an increasingly studied factor. For example, the ACA clinical trial is examining how commissural alignment affects various clinical parameters [3]. This has also been studied through CFD simulations, though only with virtual geometries and always limited to the aortic root and ascending aorta [4].
    
    This article aims to examine the **impact** of TAVI placement height and alignment on hemodynamic flow.
